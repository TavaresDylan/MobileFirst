				<h2>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</h2>

				<p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared… Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! But existing is basically all I do! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</p>

				<p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</p>

				<h2>Tell them I hate them.</h2>

				<p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>

				<p>No, I'm Santa Claus! Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>

				<h2>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</h2>

				<p>Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>

				<p>And from now on you're all named Bender Jr. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day.</p>

				<h2>What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</h2>

				<p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! We're rescuing ya.</p>

				<p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! I don't want to be rescued. That's not soon enough!</p>

				<ol>
					<li>I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</li>

					<li>And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!</li>

					<li>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</li>
